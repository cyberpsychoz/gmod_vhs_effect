# VHS Effect
Just simple VHS effect script.

This script creates a new effect called "VHSEffect" and applies it to the player's screen when they spawn. 
The effect consists of a vignette, scanlines, and an overlay texture that give the player's screen a VHS-like distortion. 
When the player dies, the effect is removed from their screen. You can customize the effect by changing the textures used for the vignette, 
scanlines, and overlay, or by modifying the code to add or remove specific components of the effect.
